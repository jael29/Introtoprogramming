				<p> <em> Huskies have a thick double coat that keeps them well insulated. Their undercoat is short and warm, while the overcoat is long and water-resistant. Their almond-shaped eyes allow them to squint to keep out snow. Huskies will wrap
						their tails around their faces while they sleep; their breath warms the tail and keeps the nose and face protected from the cold.</em></p>
