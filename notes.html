  <h1>MY HTML notes from Udacity Intro to Programming</h1>

  <h2>You can use &l t; with the opening and closing tags</h2>
  <p>
    To be able to enter the tag, and not have to enter quotations or orther characters to disply it &l t will put a starting angle bracket. </p> <br>
    <p>
      For example. you place & l t (together without space) before em>, and it will put &lt;; before em>
    </p>

    <p>If you want to do it for the closing tag you would enter & l t (without the space), then /em>. This will place also the &lt;; before the /> and it will also add the &lt;;, therefore allowing you to enter in display the tag. </p>

    <p>
      <strong>HTML definition: </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Is basically <em>plain text </em>, that is displayed on internet browsers.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong> Markup definition:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      is just text that has a special meaning.
    </p>

    <p>
      This would be text that is displayed in a specific way <em>different </em> than the rest or most of the other text
    </p>

    <p>
      <i> &lt;em> &lt;/em ></i> without the quotation marks em is used to emphasized or use italics in the text between this.

    </p>

    <h3>
      These are called tags, opening and ending tags. Them along with the text inside is referred to as element.
    </h3>

    <mark> <strong> <em>Whitespaces <sub> definition </sub> </em></strong></mark>

    <p>This space from tabs, spacebar, return/ enter key, are not displayed in browser, they will just appear all together close to one <sup> another</sup>.</p>


    <p><em>When the browser displays an HTML file, it treats a run of whitespace as a single space character </em></p><br>

    <strong> <em>Line breaks &lt;br> </em></strong>
    <p>These are Whitespaces where text is on different lines.</p>

    If we just type enter, even thought the text editor may show the line break, it will not display like that in the browser. we would need to use the &lt;br> tags, at the end of what we want to type to end the line, and start another.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Example</strong>
    This is the first line <br>
    This is the second line <br>

    the &lt;br> tag does not have a closing tag. These tags are called void element, or empty element.
    This is an HTML element with no contents and no closing tag.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Paragraph tags
      <i> &lt;p>
        &lt;/p ></i> </strong>
    <p>They work to structure with spaces a paragraph instead of using br tag.</p>

    <p>mark, sub, and sup tags</p>
    <p>Mark tag definition: <br>
      Works to be able to highlight a text.
      it has opening and closing tag
    </p>

    <p><strong> sub tag:</strong> works to makea text subscript, subindice</p>
    <p><strong> sup tag:</strong> works to make text superscript indice superior.</p>


    <p>this is a test paragraph. </p>
    <p> this is another test. </p>


    <p> p tags are what are called block elements, because they create a block invisible box around tham, and margins.
      Em, br, strong, are called inline elements, because they do not cause a separation</p>

    <p><strong>Lists</strong> <br></p>
      <p>Lists can be ordered(ol tag), or unordered (ul tag).</p>
        <p>
          <mark>
            Ordered lists</mark> by default are assigned a number starting with one.

        </p>

        <p>
          <mark> Unordered lists </mark> by default use bullet points.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can write the lists items (li tag) without the closing tag, and the list will still know it is a listed item, and proceed to the next one.
        </p>
        <p>
          <mark> However,</mark> you cannot leave out the ol or li closing tags, because if you do. The browser will not know when the list closes, and will include everything else as a list also.
        </p>
        <p>The <mark>p </mark>tag for paragraph is another example, that you could leave out the closing tag, and the browser will still know it is a paragraph and when it closes. </p>

        <h2>How to move to California:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Pack up your stuff.
            <ul>
              <li>Kitchen stuff.</li>
              <li>Bedroom stuff.</li>
              <li>Garage stuff.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Drive to California.</li>
          <li>Unpack stuff into tiny apartment.</li>

          <li>Learn Python</li>
          <li>Learn Javascript</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          p and li are the two elements you've seen with optional closing tags. And the browser knows there has to be a closing tag when it gets to the start tag of a new element that can't be inside of the last one. For example, when it gets to the
          start of a new p element, it knows the previous p element must be closed.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you put things in your own words, this helps you understand and remember the concepts better—but don't worry about making it perfect. If you're a little unsure of something, just take a shot at it. This effort by itself will help you
          develop your understanding when you encounter that concept again.

        <h2>NESTED LISTS</h2>
        <p>These are lists within a list.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mammals
            <ol>
              <li>Raccoons
              <li>Gorillas
            </ol>
          <li>Reptiles
            <ol>
              <li>Iguanas
              <li>Cobras
            </ol>
          <li>Birds
            <ol>
              <li>Ostriches
              <li>Ravens
            </ol>
        </ul>


        <p>
          The <mark> <strong> a</strong> </mark>element is an inline element. It doesn't create a box on the page. Links normally have the appearance of a specially highlighted piece of text.</p>

          <p>
            Make sure to include opening and closing tags, the link text as content, and the URL as an href attribute.
            That would look like this: <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>
          </p>

          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jermaine-robinson-duggon-86935398/">Jermaine's Linkedin Profile</a> looks like a good link to me!


          <h2>Image tags img</h2>
          <p>img tags are inline elements, and void. <br>
            This means that it does not have a closing tag, nor contents in between the opening and closing tags. </p>
          <p>
            Many websites have images that are also links: the browser displays an image, but then the user can click on that image to go to a different page. Which of these approaches do you think is used to create these?

            To create an image that is a link, put an img element between the open and close tags of an a element, for instance:
            &lt;a href="https://google.com">&lt;img src="glogo.png" alt="Google!">&lt;/a>
            This is a great example of nesting!
          </p>

          <p>In the picture link before. if you click on the bear image. <br>
            it will take you to placebear.com. <br>
            However, if you include in between the &lt;a> &lt;/'a> tags a descripotion it will put that text beside the picture.

          </p>

          <div class="container"> 
              <div class="container bear1">

                <div class="boxes bear">
              <p>If you hover your mouse on the picture. <br>
              You will get the link that it will take you to before you click. </p>
              <a href="https://placebear.com"><img src="https://placebear.com/300/300" alt="Bear from Placebear.com. Click to go to website."><br> Bear from Placebear.com. Click to go to website.</a>
          <br>
          <p>This is a random paragraph on column 1. </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="container racoon1">
            <div class="boxes racoon">
            <h2>My Ex-Boss Raza doing his thing. </h2>

            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a1/64/69/a1646966688832af73cf46055f69c45f.jpg" alt="Funny pretty racoon" width="400" height="400">
              <p>This is a random paragraph on column 2</p>
            </div>  

          </div>
        </div>

          <p>

            <mark> <strong>Relatives url, </strong> </mark>when the image or file is in our own computer binstead of the internet. <br>
            We can reference to it, by typing ints location in the src= "" field in our computer.
          </p>

          <p>
            The reason that in href google.com does not work, is because if the browser does not see <br>
            https:// it will think google.com is a relative url file hosted on the computer locally. <br>

            So if you are passing along this project to somebody, along with a relative url picture. <br>
            You will need to pass them the picture. Because, relative url in the html file does not save the picture. It pulls it from where you have it saved to. <br>

          </p>


              <h2>Image placeholders</h2>
              <p>
                Sometimes when you're working on a Web page, you don't know what images you're going to use, but you still want a picture to use as a place holder. <br>

                Websites like placebear.com and placekitten.com are designed to make this super easy. <br>
                All you have to do to get an image of any given size is put the width and height of the image at the end of the URL, as in https://placebear.com/200/300.


              </p>

              <p>
                If you enjoyed playing with those, you can find other similar sites by doing a search for "image placeholder", <br> and you'll find that there are gazillions more of them out there—like Lorem Picsum and FillMurray.com

              <h2>Doctype html tag. </h2>
              <p>PREVIOUS DOCTYPE TAGS <BR>they were too long.
                <img src="old-doctypetags.png" alt="">
              </p>

              <h2>New Modern Doctype TAGS</h2>


                They have been simplified.
                <img src="new-doctypetags.png" alt="">

                <p>With the doctype tag we are letting the browser know the type of html file we are working with in this case which is Html5.
                  Without it the browser will go into what is called quirks mode.

                <H2>Parts of an HTML document</H2>

                <p>Everything we have seen so far lives in the 2nd part of the HTML document. The body.</p>

                <h3>The body.</h3>

                  <ol>
                    <li>Lists</li>

                  <h3>The Head</h3>
                  <p>This is where we put important pieces of information about the document. </p>

                  <p>Both the head and the body occur inside a single document called HTML. </p>

                  <h3>Few things that appear inside the Head of an HTML document.</h3>
                  <ol>

                        <li>This is the only piece that is required.

                            <li>This is placed between and opening and closing title tag.
